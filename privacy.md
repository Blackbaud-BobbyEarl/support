## PullApprove Privacy Policy

We will never sell your private data or information. We don't give out your private info to organizations that may sell it. We do though disclose some customer information to SaaS providers that we use in order to make the PullApprove service functional. Those third party companies include Amazon, Google Analytics, New Relic, Mandrill, Stripe, and Intercom - each of these has their own privacy policies.
