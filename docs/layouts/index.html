            <h2>Welcome to the PullApprove docs!</h2>
            <p class="lead">Frankly, we're proud of the fact that there isn't much documentation required to use
            PullApprove. But there are some things, and more on the way, that will need a small amount of documentation.</p>
            <p class="lead">The majority of documentation is related to the <code>.pullapprove.yml</code> file, and pages for each of the available settings
            can be found in the menu on the left side of every page.</p>
            <p class="lead">If you have any questions, comments, or ideas for PullApprove or these docs check out our <a href="https://github.com/pullapprove/support">public issues repo on GitHub!</a></p>
